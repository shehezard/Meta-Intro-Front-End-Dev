        Visual layout

        When viewing the home page in the browser:

            Is it clear that this is a home page for one of the four fictional clients?
                I have made it clear that this is a home page for Little Lemon by including the logo and the name of the restaurant in the header.

            Is the correct company logo at the top of the page?
                I have added the Little Lemon company logo is at the top of the page.

            Is there a horizontal navigation menu with four links below the logo?
                I have added a horizontal navigation menu with four links next to the logo using the flex box.
                I did it this way as a design decision to express my creative side.

            Does one of the links in the navigation menu link to the home page itself?
                I have added a link to the home page itself in the navigation menu.

            Does the main content contain a large promotional banner at the top and three columns below it, each containing an image and some text?
                I have added a large promotional banner at the top and three columns below it, each containing an image and some text.

            Does the page have a footer that is split into two columns?
                I have added a footer that is split into two columns.

            Does the left column of the footer contain a small version of the client logo and the right column copyright text?
                I have added a small version of the client logo and the right column copyright text.

        Semantic structure

        When opening the HTML file in VS Code, does it contain:

            A header element for the logo?
                I have added a header element for the containing the logo.

            A nav element for the navigation menu?
                I have added a nav element for the navigation menu.

            A main element for the content?
                I have added a main element for the content.

            A footer element for the footer?
                I have added a footer element for the footer.

            Appropriate usage of other semantic tags such as article and section in the content of the main element?
                I have added separate each part into sections, and each item into articles. Avoid using div as much as possible, and try to use semantic HTML elements.
